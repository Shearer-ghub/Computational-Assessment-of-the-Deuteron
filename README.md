# Computational-Assessment-of-the-Deuteron
Computational Assessment of the Deuteron completed as UCD final year lab assignment for computational studies in Astrophysics.

In this computational assessment of the Deuteron graphical and computational methods were used to deduce information about the nature of the
deuteron atom. The results found were in strong agreement with current
theoretical predictions as well as experimental measurements of said characterises. These were chiefly the binding energy of the Deuteron, found to
be 2.22MeV and the implications of a loosely bound structure through the
predicted separation between proton neutron due to its low binding energy
as well as the prediction of finding the nucleon within the potential well
(internuclear force) as 32%, representing a greater likelihood of a separation
of the n-p in the deuteron.
